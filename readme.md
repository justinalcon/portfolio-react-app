# React Bootstrap
## A skeleton for HTML5 sites with a Gulp build process for Sass + ReactJS + Browserify.

Currently a client-side web app. 

### Build Process
1. Confirm that you have latest npm (install via NodeJS if necessary)
2. Run `npm install` to download dependencies
3. From the root directory, run `gulp`

You should now have a running webserver, with livereload, and a watcher build task that compiles scss and js.

### Todo:
* Research server-side rendering
* Implement a data store architecture (e.g. Flux, or Redux)
* Create Prod build process
