# Discovery Front-End
## An Isomorphic Single-Page Application

### Toolset:
1. [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Component-based javascript framework for building UI's
2. [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) - Robust implementaiton of the [Flux Application Architecure](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html)
3. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor for extended functionality
4. [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) - Dependency management across javascript files
5. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - ES6+ javascript transpiler
6. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Build process and automation tool

### Build Process:

##### This how to instantiate the project and run the automation tools on OS X. 
npm is the package manager that will download dependencies, and gulp is the command line tool for automation tasks.

1. Confirm that you have latest npm (run `npm -v`, if it says not found then install via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
2. From the root directory, run `npm install` to download dependencies
3. Confirm that you have gulp installed on your command line (run `gulp`, if not found run `npm install -g gulp`, possible requiring sudo)
4. If installed, running `gulp` from the root directly will run the default task to setup a webserver with livereload, and a watcher build task that compiles scss and js on save.
5. Source files in in `/` and `./src`, while compiled files will be put in `./public`

Now you're up and ready to begin coding!

### Production Build:
Run the task `gulp buildProd` to generate production-ready css + jss in `./public/dist`.

Add a file at the root directory called `env.js` with one line specifying your build environment: `export const NODE_ENV = "production"`. Without this file, the default value is assumed to be `"development"`.

Changing that variable between `development||production` will affect which files are included in the swig template in `./src/views`

### Important Disclaimer for Client-Facing Projects:
This bootstrap is setup to transpile next generation ES6+ javascript syntax to browser-supported ES5+ syntax, including experimental features by default. If you're building a client-facing project, **BEFORE STARTING TO CODE**, strongly consider these suggestions for improved stability.

* Remove the more experimental `stage-0` from the babel config in `gulpfile.js`
* [shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap) your npm dependencies to exact version numbers

### Notes on How Isomorphic Works:
Isomorphic Web-Apps can run both server-side and client-side, while sharing the same codebase. The code is pre-rendered and delivered as HTML, where the client can pick back up and continue running the application.
##### In our case:
1. **gulp** runs a **node** server at `./server.js`  
2. Request is processed and **react-router**, shared between client & server, decides correct React component to render.
3. **ReactDOM/server** method **renderToString()** coverts the React component to an HTML string.
4. **Iso**, [an isomorphic Alt helper library]((https://github.com/goatslacker/iso)), assists in passing on the data server-side.
5. Final HTML is rendered to a **swig** template and sent to client.
6. **Iso** bootstraps the passed down data and re-hydrates the client-side React components.

### How to do Remote Preview
1. Run the Node server like normal
2. Get your IP address. (On Linux run `ifconfig|grep inet`, and look for `inet XX.XX.XX.XXX netmask 0xfffffc00 ...`)
3. Navigate to http://-your-ip-:port on your remote device

### Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty

#### git
    
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install git

#### Get the code:

1. generate an ssh key, and add it to bitbucket if this deploy machine is new

#### NODE & NPM

    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    $ sudo apt-get install npm
    $ cd /var/www/
    $ sudo mkdir discovery
    $ sudo chown ubuntu discovery
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:cnstudiotech/discovery-fe-app.git discovery
    $ cd discovery


#### GULP
    $sudo npm install -g gulp
  
#### Install
    $ npm install
    $ gulp
